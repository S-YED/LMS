## Introduction

The Mini Leave Management System is a streamlined application designed to manage employee leave requests within an organization. The system enables employees to apply for leave, managers to approve or reject requests, and provides comprehensive tracking of leave balances and history. This system aims to digitize and automate the traditional paper-based leave management process, ensuring transparency, efficiency, and accurate record-keeping.
